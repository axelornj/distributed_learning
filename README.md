# Distributed learning
Distributed learning algorithm. For Autonomous Multi-Agent Systems course.

The distributed learning algorithm from the paper "Distributed learning and cooperative control for multi-agent systems" utilizes cooperation and flocking of multiple agents to explore an unknown potential field. This model is partially bio-
logically inspired by the movement of algae, searching to maximize their local sustenance supply. The report will set up the mathematical formulation of the algorithm and discuss the flocking, cooperation and control of the system specifically. We presented with an artificial potential and look at the implementation of that, including the possible ability to dodge certain objects in the environment. The algorithm was implemented in R.
